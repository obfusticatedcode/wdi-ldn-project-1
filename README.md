# What3Words Trading App

This is a trading app built in JavaScript that helps people buy and sell products in areas where there are no formal addresses, like many third-world countries.

## How to Use

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Download or copy the code from this repository.
2. Install the required software by running a command: `yarn`.
3. Start the app by running another command: `gulp`.

> **Note:** You'll need to have a program called `gulp-cli` installed on your computer. You can get it by running `npm i -g gulp-cli`.

## What This App Does

This project brings together various technologies to create an online marketplace. It's powered by Node.js and Express. One unique feature is its integration with What3Words (W3W), a system that helps people describe locations in areas without traditional addresses.

W3W divides the world into small squares and gives each square a unique three-word address. This way, anyone can easily find and share locations, even in places without street names.

With this app, people can trade products online, making it possible for those in areas with limited addresses to buy and sell things over the internet.

## Technology Used

This app is made with several technologies, including:

- HTML 5
- SCSS (a type of CSS)
- JavaScript ES6 (a version of JavaScript)
- jQuery 3.10 (a JavaScript library)
- Gulp (a tool for automating tasks)
- Yarn (a package manager like npm)
- Git & GitHub (for code storage and collaboration)
- Heroku (a platform for hosting web apps)

## Challenges We Faced

While building this app, we ran into some challenges, such as:

- Dealing with limited access to certain online services (APIs) and figuring out how to use them effectively.
- Learning the importance of careful planning and thinking through the code before writing it.
- Making the app use as little internet data as possible, especially since it's meant for use in areas with limited internet access.

## Future Plans

In the future, I hope to make the app even better by:

1. Adding categories and sub-categories to make it easier to find products.
2. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to suggest products to users based on their interests.
3. Allowing users to log in with their Facebook accounts since many people use Facebook.
4. Improving the in-app messaging system for better security.
5. Adding a gallery for users to upload images of the products they're selling.
