#### Description
Bringing together all the different technologies to create an online adspace. Node.js and express

Here is free online space for you to trade, linked with what3words; a simple way to talk about location for the 75% of countries without formal addresses. W3W divided the world into a grid of 3m x 3m squares and assigned each one a unique 3 word address. Anyone can accurately find any location and share it quickly and easily. Buying and selling online is now for everyone.

#### Challenges faced

Using trial APIs where the limits are set to 1000 requests for a month and realising that they're not https so have to use proxies.

I learnt that I should spend about 70% of my time planning and psuedo coding and 30% coding. Planning is  key.

Making the app use less data as it's targeted for 3rd world countries.



#### Conclusion
Going forward, I'd like to implement the following:

1. Have categories and sub-categories
2. Have AI and allow the computer to make clever suggestions based on what the user likes.
3. Login with facebook as the majority of people use it.
4. Have in app messaging which is more secure
5. Have a gallery for images posted
