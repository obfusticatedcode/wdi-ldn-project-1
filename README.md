# What3Words Trading App

This trading app, built using JavaScript, helps buying and selling products in regions without formal addresses, typically found in developing countries.

## Overview

The app integrates the What3Words (W3W) system, which segments the world into small squares, each identified by a unique three-word address. This enables easy location sharing, even in places without street names or traditional addresses. Our platform makes online trading feasible for those in regions with limited addressing capabilities.
